# TwinTracker
A simple timer app to track feeding and vitamins input for my twin daugthers born on September 8th 2017 :-)

Main activity allows for feeding tracking (with automatic timer), manual feeding input (for forgotten midnight bottles) and manual vitamin input.
History activity displays the last 30 feeding (for both twins).
