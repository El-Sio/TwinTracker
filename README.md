# TwinTracker
A simple Android app to keep track of feedings, vitamins and iron supplement inputs for my twin daughters born on September 8th 2017 :-)

Main activity allows for feeding tracking (with automatic timer), manual feeding input (for forgotten midnight bottles) and manual vitamin and iron input.
UI elements change colors depending on the delay since last input (once a day for vitamins, twice a day for iron, every ~4h or so for feeding).

History activity displays the last 36 feeding (about 3 days worth of data for both twins).

Data is stored online in JSON form through very simple php scripts allowing for multi-client input.
